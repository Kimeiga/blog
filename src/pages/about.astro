  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer with over 5 years of experience building web applications 
    and developer tools. I started my journey in tech through self-teaching and have 
    since worked with startups and established companies to build products that users love.
  </p>

  <h2>Skills & Technologies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js</li>
    <li>Python, Go, Rust</li>
    <li>Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Cloudflare)</li>
    <li>Database design (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)</li>
    <li>DevOps & CI/CD</li>
    <li>API design & microservices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that are both 
    performant and delightful to use. I'm a strong advocate for open source and love 
    contributing to the developer community.
  </p>

  <h2>Outside of Code</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you can find me reading sci-fi novels, hiking, or 
    experimenting with new coffee brewing methods.
